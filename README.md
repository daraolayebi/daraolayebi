### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dara and I'm a Frontend Engineer based in Nigeria.

I have 4+ years of hands-onÂ experience building websites and applications, and developing a strong understanding of what separates a good product from a great product. I love the work that I do, particularly bringing ideas to life through code. My core interests lie where design and engineering merge.

I'm also very passionate about mentoring young women who are keen to get into the tech space. I recently partnered with CodeCollabs and Black Girls In Tech, and have since attained a number of mentees based in different cities across the world.

I currently work at a startup that's focused on crypto-based solutions for Africans. 

Some of my goals at the moment are to start documenting my everyday learnings, contribute to open source projects, and level up my knowledge on deFi and web3.
