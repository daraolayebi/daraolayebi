### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dara and I'm a Software Engineer based in London.

I love the work that I do, specifically because I get to build solutions that make life easier for people and communities. Over the years, I have built / contributed to hundreds of web applications and features, and developed a strong understanding of what separates a good product from a great product. 

I'm very passionate about mentoring other women who are keen to get into the tech space. In the past, I have partnered with CodeCollabs and Black Girls In Tech, and am always open to taking on more mentees anywhere in the world.
