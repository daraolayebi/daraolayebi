### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dara and I'm a Frontend Engineer based in Nigeria.

I have 4+ years of hands-onÂ experience building websites and applications, and developing a strong understanding of what separates a good product from a great product. I love the work that I do, specifically because I get to build solutions that make life easier for people and communities.

I'm very passionate about mentoring other women who are keen to get into the tech space. In the past, I have partnered with CodeCollabs and Black Girls In Tech, and am always open to taking on more mentees anywhere in the world.

I currently work at a startup that's focused on building crypto-based solutions for Africans. 

Some of my goals at the moment are to start documenting my everyday learnings, contribute more to open source projects, and level up my knowledge on deFi and web3.
